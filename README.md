##Virtual Reality Hands-Free CAD Manipulation


The initial idea was to use Oculus Rift in collaboration with Leap Motion in order to take a CAD file and take it apart into small components by just using hand gestures. However, we encountered problems with Oculus Rift and had to switch gears. We decided to use Google Cardboard and the Myo in order to do the same thing. Because Google Cardboard needs a phone for the virtual reality, we had to create an Android App, but we were unsure if we would be able to stream the application to a large audience, so we also created a desktop version that can be controlled with Myo.

To run go to Assets/_Scenes/CADViewer.unity
